[h1] Criminal Worlds: Enclaves & Veterans [/h1]

MASSIVELY EXANDED, UPDATED TO 4.2 AND BUGS FIXED

Across Science Fiction there are numerous examples of worlds that are controlled by criminal organizations; Tatooine was a particular inspiration of mine. On these planets, scum and villany are abundant, and any authorities that exist struggle to keep the law in check. While Stellaris has a host of criminal events that try to build this atmosphere, I've always felt they lack immersion. This mod helps to cover those gaps by adding a whole host of events that can occur, from crime organizations building interstellar enclaves to corrupting your enforcers.

This mod does make crime more punishing as there are more events that can cause problems and they are more likely. However, it also adds a number of positive events and ways to profit from criminals that can make having a crime world or two maybe worth considering. Additionally, criminals can build enclaves which will expand and anyone can trade with. Afterall, a number of existing governments use the criminal organizations within them to their advantage. ([i]An enclave of skilled hackers could prove very useful in obtaining your enemies' tech.[/i])

There's too much to discuss in this description, so here are some highlights:
- 50+ New Events which reflect the growing influence of criminals on your planets
- 3 Criminal Enclave Types which spawn and expand based on your interactions
- 3 New Unlockable Veteran Classes with new leader traits and all with custom artwork
- Criminality & Deviancy Traditions with dynamic swaps and unique benefits
- New Jobs, Civics, Tech, Anomalies, Espionage Operations, Modifiers, etc...

The AI will use the new features and be affected by these events.

The mod is currently only available in English. (translators welcome)
