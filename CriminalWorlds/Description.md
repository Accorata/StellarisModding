[h1] Criminal Worlds [/h1] (more to do...)

Across Science Fiction there are numerous examples of worlds that are controlled by criminal organizations: Tatooine, for example. On these planets, scum and villany are abundant, and authorities struggle to keep the law in check. While Stellaris has a host of criminal events that try to build this atmosphere, I've always felt they lack immersion. This helps to cover those gaps by adding a whole host of events that can occur, from crime organizations building fleets to corrupting your enforcers.

This mod does make crime more punishing as there are more events that can cause problems and they are more likely. However, it also adds a number of positive benefits/events that can make having a crime world or two maybe worth considering. Afterall, a number of existing governments use the criminal organizations within them to their advantage. ([i]Maybe the local mercenaries might come in handy in this next war[/i])

The mod is currently only available in English. (translators welcome)

[h2] Compatibility [/h2]

No DLC requirements.

Zero base game files harmed (Should be compatible with all other mods)

NOT achievement compatible ([i]Only UI mods that don't change features can be[/i])

[h2] Features [/h2]

This mod introduces 30 new events (with varied changes based on government). These events are mostly new criminal events, however this mod does include a few new crime-related anomalies and special projects.

These all provide an array of new planet modifiers, new jobs, new armies, and a new relic!

Includes a bunch of new stories, new icons for new jobs/leader traits, and new artwork for the relic.

Very few of these events are available for gestalt empires, as the flavor is much harder to create and adapt. The AI will also be affected by these events.
