## Planet Events ##
# Corruption 1-3
  criminal_worlds.10.name:0 "Bribed Enforcers on [Root.GetName]"
  criminal_worlds.10.desc:0 "The number of arrests on [Root.GetName] have dropped off even as crime rises. It wouldn't be unreasonable to assume that some of our enforcers tasked with taking down these criminal networks have fallen into the pockets of the very organizations they were supposed to fight.\n\nClearly they need a return to their moral principles and a larger force may be needed to root out this problem."
  criminal_worlds.11.name:0 "Extended Corruption on [Root.GetName]"
  criminal_worlds.11.desc:0 "Whether these are new developments or have always been the case, it appears the system of bribery on [Root.GetName] is much larger than originally assumed. We hoped these corrupt enforcers would be brought to justice upon discovery, but after throughly reviewing their internal documents, it seems even their superiors are also upon the payroll of the criminal networks and are happy to cover up the corruption.\n\nIt's even unclear whether the arrests we originally made when we discovered this corruption were legitimate or just innocent enforcers thrown under the bus by the higher ups."
  criminal_worlds.12.name:0 "Political Corruption on [Root.GetName]"
  criminal_worlds.12.desc:0 "The sources of our crime troubles have become clear.\n\nIts not just an internalized system of corruption within our enforcers, the corruption goes all the way to the top. The very politicians that we've put in place have abandoned our population, turning to the pursuit of profit over justice. This corruption is far larger than any of our estimates and is going to take a true effort to take it down."
# Illegal Freeports
  criminal_worlds.20.name:0 "Illegal Freeports appear on [Root.GetName]"
  criminal_worlds.20.desc:0 "Our local enforcers on [Root.GetName] have begun to encover a number of criminal safe havens, which would explain the increase in local traffic to [Root.GetName]. However estimates on the number of these freeports puts the number far higher than have been shutdown."
# Criminal Shipyards - x3 by Crime Lord Deal
  criminal_worlds.21.name:0 "$cw_criminal_shipyards$ on [Root.GetName]"
	criminal_worlds.21.desc:0 "It seems that for the criminal organizations, control of [Root.GetName] is not enough. Enforcers have discovered multiple cases of stolen alloy transports. They suspect weapons are being maunfactured elsewhere on [Root.GetName].\n\nA number of planetside rogue shipyards are now building the criminals a new fleet. We better hope they are just as interested in protecting [Root.GetName] as we are."
  criminal_worlds.22.name:0 "$cw_criminal_shipyards_2$ on [Root.GetName]"
	criminal_worlds.22.desc:0 "The operations have expanded. No longer do the organizations rely purely on stolen alloys: now entire factories are under their control for this purpose alone. Shipyards of real size can now be found, and their influence is beyond the control of local authority.\n\nFurther enforcement seems to be the only  way to regain our own sovereignity over [Root.GetName] and reclaim ship construction."
  criminal_worlds.22.a:0 "Arrest them all!"
  criminal_worlds.22.b:0 "At least they're not harming anyone."
# Criminal Fleet Appears
  criminal_worlds.26.name:0 "Syndicate Fleet constructed above [Root.GetName]"
  criminal_worlds.26.desc:0 "The rogue shipbuilders on [Root.GetName] have constructed their first batch of ships, that now occupy the airspace above the planet. At the moment, they remain passive in stance and action, but we are unsure of what may happen next.\n\nThey are at the moment only a small force, but as long as the operations on [Root.GetName] continue, who knows how large they'll get."
  criminal_worlds.26.a:0 "Concerning."
# Underground Slums
  criminal_worlds.30.name:0 "Underground Slums appear on [Root.GetName]"
	criminal_worlds.30.desc:0 "The housing crisis on [Root.GetName] have forced some of our population belowground, into sewars and abandoned tunnels. This should lessen the problems of the homelessness, however these areas are beyond the reach of society or enforcement, and will likely remain a lawless zone."
  criminal_worlds.31.name:0 "Underground Slums increase on [Root.GetName]"
	criminal_worlds.31.desc:0 "The underground slums have grown in popularity as more and more people turn to the depths for housing. They shouldn't pose too large of a problem, however it is unfortunate to lose more and more promising individuals who might otherwise bring great positive impact to society."
# Mercenary Fighters - Prevented by Crime Lord Deal
  criminal_worlds.32.name:0 "Mercenary Fighters on [Root.GetName]"
	criminal_worlds.32.desc:0 "Mercenary groups have taken up hold on [Root.GetName], recruiting any able-bodied they can find under the promise of wealth. These warriors are causing problems across the planet as they perform jobs for the high paying and as they carelessly practice. All minor problems, but distressing for any locals nonetheless.\n\nHowever, if we happen to need an army, these mercenaries should provide a quick and cheap solution without too many drawbacks compared to drafting militias."
  criminal_worlds.32.a:0 "$WORRYING$"
# Infamous Criminal - Prevented by Crime Lord Deal
  criminal_worlds.33.name:0 "Infamous Criminals on [Root.GetName]"
	criminal_worlds.33.desc:0 "A number of terrible personalities of the streets of [Root.GetName] have become well known across our empire. Their brazeness towards our authority has inspired others that are lacking a cause to cause trouble.\n\nClearly the problem has gotten out of hand if our enforcers can't even capture notorious individuals who are making a spectacle out of this."
  criminal_worlds.33.a:0 "This needs to stop."
# Black Market Relic - x3 by Crime Lord Deal
  criminal_worlds.34.name:0 "Rumored Dealings on [Root.GetName]"
	criminal_worlds.34.desc:0 "Within the network of black markets on [Root.GetName], local authorities have recieved an anonymous tip from someone who claims to have heard of a powerful item up for sale. Details are incredibly sparse, and it's unclear how legitimate this source is.\n\nOur enforcers are already tied up with the regular criminal dealings, but passed this up the chain if we are interested in deploying our own efforts to confirm or deny this tip."
  criminal_worlds.34.a:0 "Survey local rumors on [Root.GetName]."
  criminal_worlds.34.b:0 "There are more important things than this."
  criminal_worlds.35.name:0 "Surveys Complete!"
	criminal_worlds.35.desc:0 "The anonymous tip was correct. Multiple new reports came back when futher investigation began confirming the tip and giving new insights as to possible locations. The contraband is believed to be made up of a collection of small ancient artifacts that a collector somehow came into possession of.\n\nNow the small collection is being passed through the highest bidding tables as various crime lords pay higher and higher amounts."
  criminal_worlds.35.a:0 "Retrieve this contraband!"
  criminal_worlds.36.name:0 "Artifacts Seized!"
	criminal_worlds.36.desc:0 "It took multiple covert operations into multiple crime rings on [Root.GetName], but the collection is now in our possession. These small trinkets are confirmed to be of ancient age, but initial analysis hasn't found anything special that would lead to such high market prices for the crime lords."
  criminal_worlds.36.a:0 "Analyze what we've confiscated."
  criminal_worlds.37.name:0 "Relic Found!"
	criminal_worlds.37.desc:0 "Upon investigating the stash of artifacts further, one medallion stood out. Its foreign green metal is inscribed with ancient runes and attached to a bare chain. It continued to attract the attention of our scientists, as if it was calling out.\n\nFurther analysis revealed it to be a relic of great power, one that contains powerful psionic energy. It's origins and purpose are unknown, but our lead researcher on the project began to hear a name in the dreams: 'Etrioki'. Our archeology team has concluded the the runes most likely depict a king above subjects, and the psionic power of this relic clearly holds much weight over the weakened mind. Now it is ours, for whatever use we wish of it."
  criminal_worlds.37.a:0 "Wonderful."
  criminal_worlds.38.name:0 "Artifacts Analyzed"
	criminal_worlds.38.desc:0 "Among these trinkets is something of greater value: a precursor artifact that helps explain the origins of our universe. Initial analyses missed the artifact as it had been split up into four parts during the seizure from the crime lords, but now that it has been reconstructed, we know even more about the mysteries of what came before."
  criminal_worlds.38.a:0 "$criminal_worlds.37.a$"
  criminal_worlds.38.b:0 "Unfortunately Redundant."
# Criminal Worlds
  criminal_worlds.40.name:0 "Criminal Influence over [Root.GetName]"
	criminal_worlds.40.desc:0 "Criminal organizations on [Root.GetName] have begun to consolidate their operations, wrestling planet control further away from our control. Now more and more planetside businesses lie within their sphere, and [Root.GetName] has begun to operate somewhat independently."
  criminal_worlds.40.a:0 "$UNFORTUNATE$"
  criminal_worlds.41.name:0 "Criminals Increase on [Root.GetName]"
	criminal_worlds.41.desc:0 "Futher quiet expansions of power lie in the shadows on [Root.GetName]. The low lives have always craved for greater control and now, new criminal leadership is granting them oppurtunity.\n\nIf we do not act quickly, this planet's loyalties may never lie with us again. At least these organizations have reduced our own need for planetary management and upkeep."
  criminal_worlds.41.a:0 "$UNFORTUNATE$"
  criminal_worlds.42.name:0 "Criminal Consolidation on [Root.GetName]"
	criminal_worlds.42.desc:0 "The criminal organizations are now united under a single syndicate that has continued to wrestle power away from our authority. At this point, the criminal networks are so entrenched in life on [Root.GetName] that their removal would disrupt the entire flow of society.\n\nWe can only hope that enforcers can prevent the situation from getting any worse. However, judging by past action, that future does not seem likely."
  criminal_worlds.42.a:0 "Terrible."
  criminal_worlds.43.name:0 "Criminal Control of [Root.GetName]"
	criminal_worlds.43.desc:0 "Loyalties are gone. To call [Root.GetName] a planet of our nation would make others laugh. Rather, [Root.GetName] is a place of the syndicate where crime looms and shady deals take place. Local industry swears allegiance to the criminals, claiming that they now take care of [Root.GetName] far more than we ever had or ever would."
  criminal_worlds.43.a:0 "Terrible."
  criminal_worlds.44.name:0 "[Root.GetName] is a Criminal World"
	criminal_worlds.44.desc:0 "[Root.GetName] has fallen into the hands of criminals. National sovereignity is all but unheard of and [Root.GetName] shows only its allegiance in name.\n\nThe word 'criminal' has lost all meaning there. Now there is no distinction between those who hope for a better future and those who hope for quick reward: all life is bound up, one way or another, in the great syndicate that holds power here."
  criminal_worlds.44.a:0 "Terrible."
  criminal_worlds.51.name:0 "[Root.GetName] remains a Criminal World"
	criminal_worlds.51.desc:0 "After over numerous years of [Root.GetName] being controlled by criminal factions, progress seems extremely bleak. The syndicate that controls this planet shows no signs of weakening, and criminal experts say that it will continue to terrorize our people for at least ten more years and likely more if we refuse to take action.\n\nTo call [Root.GetName] a planet of the [Root.Owner.GetName] would be an exaggeration."
  criminal_worlds.51.a:0 "Terrible."
# Freedom fighters
  criminal_worlds.45.name:0 "Freedom Fighters on [Root.GetName]"
	criminal_worlds.45.desc:0 "It seems there are opponents to our methods of slavery present on [Root.GetName]. So much so that an underground organization has sprung up, dedicated to freeing the oppressed. If we do not crack down on these pathetic rebels, they just might have some success."
  criminal_worlds.45.a:0 "$UNFORTUNATE$"
  criminal_worlds.47.name:0 "Slaves Escape from [Root.GetName]"
	criminal_worlds.47.desc:0 "The rebel freedom fighters have finally managed to achieve something of note: they were able to hijack a shipping vessel and use it to aid slaves in their escape. Arrests have been made but without further enforcement this tragedy may repeat."
  criminal_worlds.47.a:0 "$UNFORTUNATE$"
  criminal_worlds.47.a.tooltip:0 "100 Enslaved Pops on [Root.GetName] have escaped to another country."
# Unlicensed Slave Trade
  criminal_worlds.48.name:0 "Unlicensed Slave Trade"
	criminal_worlds.48.desc:0 "Local authorities on [Root.GetName] have uncovered a large slave trade masterminded by criminal forces. The slaves had been captured in the [cw_enslaved_species_owner.GetName] before being transported here. What started as minor investigations into unexplained alien appearances quickly revealed the sinister operations. Fortunately, the enslaved have been freed, and now the decision of what to do with them is ours."
  criminal_worlds.48.a:0 "Return them to the [cw_enslaved_species_owner.GetName]."
  criminal_worlds.48.b:0 "Free them on [Root.GetName]."
  criminal_worlds.48.c:0 "We could use some more slaves."
  criminal_worlds.48.d:0 "Kill them all."
  criminal_worlds.48.e:0 "Tasty."
  criminal_worlds.48.evopred:0 "Delicious."
# Freed Slaves (Fired from 48 if empire returns them)
  criminal_worlds.49.name:0 "Slaves Returned"
	criminal_worlds.49.desc:0 "We've received reports from the [From.Owner.GetName] that they encountered a number of our population who had been enslaved and smuggled onto one of their planets. The ships carrying our freed citizens are just now reaching our border and we welcome them back with great joy. Many of them had been reported dead or been missing for such an extended period of time that it seemed they'd never return. Across our planets there is much gratitude for the [From.Owner.GetName]."

Further analysis might shine a brighter light on their experiences."

While [Root.GetLeaderName] isn't sure what, they do feel the same evil, and it doesn't show any signs of stopping.\n\nUpon this news reaching the scientific body of the nation, some call for further study and a research base on §Y[Root.GetName]§!.

Every time the ship computers communicate with each other for navigation data, there is a small chance the virus will be attached to the transimission. Given the rapid communications between modern warcraft, within moments the virus will have found its way into every ship computer in the fleet. Upon the fleets next naval involvement, the virus will activate, rewritting sensor data to remove the distinctions between enemy and ally and wreak havoc until thoroughly purged by antiviral programs."
