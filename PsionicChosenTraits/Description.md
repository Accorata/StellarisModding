[h1] Destiny Chosen Traits [/h1]

Destiny Chosen Traits is a small mod that changes the visuals of the chosen one psionic leader traits with no gameplay modifications. 

These leader traits (Chosen One and Chosen of the Eater/Instrument/Composer/Whisperers) now will appear as destiny traits however they will not prevent the leader from gaining a normal destiny trait at level 8. Additionally, the psionic age leader trait (that can be granted to your leaders via a shroud option) now displays as a psionic trait.

This mod has no language files and thus is available regardless of your language!

If you're looking for new gameplay features, feel free to try out another mod of mine [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3155609462]Psionic Leader Traits[/url]!

[h2] Compatibility [/h2]

Modified the base game file with the Chosen traits, which also includes the ascension leader traits (Should be compatible with all other mods that don't also override this file)
(Should work properly with any mods that allow for multiple ascension paths, such as allowing Cybernetic Psionics)

NOT achievement compatible ([i]Only some UI mods can be[/i])
