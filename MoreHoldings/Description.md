[h1] More Holdings [/h1]

More Holdings is a small mod that adds a few new overlord holdings to Stellaris. More will likely be added in the future, and all suggestions as for what to add are completely welcome!

All holdings which provide jobs will also switch to providing drone jobs for gestalt subjects.

The mod is currently only available in English (translators welcome).

[h2] Compatibility [/h2]

This mod doesn't require any DLC, but some holdings will require features from other DLC. ([i]Ex: The Synaptic Packager holding requires the Cosmogenesis Ascension perk from The Machine Age DLC.[/i])

Zero base game files harmed (Should be compatible with all other mods)

NOT achievement compatible ([i]Only UI mods that don't change features can be[/i])
