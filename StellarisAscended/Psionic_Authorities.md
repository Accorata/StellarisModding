[h2] Psionic Authorities [/h2]

A few months after completing the Psionic ascension path, an event chain called "Telepathic Destiny" will begin. Through a starting event and then two more follow up events, your nation will choose between the divine or the eldritch. The final event will allow your nation to reform its authority into the divine version, eldritch version, or remain as is. Whether the divine option, eldritch option, or both is/are available will depend on your decisions in the event chain. Additionally, nations with the Teachers of the Shroud origin will instead get an event that switches them to one of their own sets of authorities. (Similar to the Cybernetic Creed origin and its unique authorities.)
