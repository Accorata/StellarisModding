To exploit it, these machines built bigger than ever before. A mighty §H$tech_orbital_arc_furnace$§! now dominates their sky, but these master engineers are far from satisfied.\n\nThe galaxy awaits, and the possibilities are endless. All it takes is the ingenuity to seize them."

  START_SCREEN_AC_BORN_OF_CODE: "Years of exploitation have left [Root.Capital.GetName] barren. But the skies above are rich with resources, and with an ambition matched only by our ingenuity, we now seek a livelihood in space.\n\nInitial construction of the $tech_orbital_arc_furnace$ was a massive undertaking, and its potential is immense. Upgrading it to full capacity is an obvious next step, as is the need for system-wide resource extraction. But what lies beyond our borders? What incredible opportunities await the artful engineer?\n\nWith the advent of FTL travel our designs are no longer limited to a single system. The galaxy is our drafting board, and it is time to get to work."

  START_SCREEN_LITHOID:0 "While our true origins are unknown, we do know that our presapient ancestors arrived on a vast meteorite which slammed into [GetHomeWorldName] in a fiery cataclysm and wiped out most of the native inhabitants.\n\nIn the eons since, the first primitive [GetSpeciesName] spread out over [GetHomeWorldName], evolved, and multiplied. Our civilization has spread and prospered, and with the invention of the [GetStartingDrive] we stand ready to explore the galaxy."
