[h1] Psionic Leader Traits [/h1]

UPDATED FOR 3.11

Psionic Leader Traits is a small mod that adds many new veteran traits (and a couple of destiny and negative traits) that are available to any Psionic leader. I hoped to represent psionic concepts (mind reader to precognition to generalized consciousness) that certain Sci-Fi stories delve into and bring those ideas, however basic, into the framework of Stellaris.

These leader traits are weighted to be somewhat rare and balanced to be slightly more powerful than an average trait, however like any leader trait, their effectiveness will vary on the current strategy.

The mod is currently only available in English (translators welcome).

[h2] Compatibility [/h2]

Features require Galactic Paragons DLC, and some specific traits may only appear/will be modified slightly based on other DLCs. ([i]Ex: Cloaking with First Contact[/i])

Zero base game files harmed (Should be compatible with all other mods)
(Should also work properly with any mods that allow for multiple ascension paths, such as allowing Cybernetic Psionics)

NOT achievement compatible ([i]Only UI mods that don't change features can be[/i])
