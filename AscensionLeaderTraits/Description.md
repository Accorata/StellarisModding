[h1] Ascension Leader Traits [/h1]

Ascension Leader Traits adds many new veteran, negative, and destiny traits that are available to any leader who has a trait from an ascension path. Each aims to focus on more specific abilities that leaders could develop from psionic otherworldly visions to having a cybernetic swiss-army knife built-in to one's arm, to failing subroutines in a synthetic.

These leader traits are weighted to be somewhat rare and balanced to be slightly more powerful than an average trait, however like any leader trait, their effectiveness will vary on one's current strategy and build.

The mod is available in English, [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3254340455]Korean[/url] (thanks 재프jeff!), and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3255625917]Japanese[/url] (thanks akito0158!). Translators welcome.

[h2] Compatibility [/h2]

Features require Galactic Paragons DLC, and some specific traits may only appear/will be modified slightly based on other DLCs. ([i]Ex: Cloaking with First Contact, Astral Rifts with Astral Planes[/i])

Zero base game files harmed (Should be compatible with all other mods)
(Work withs any mods that allow for multiple ascension paths, such as allowing Cybernetic Psionics)

This mod is a collection of four mods released previously by me (and then I upgraded them a lot with a bunch of new traits and completely new art), but will likely cause compatibility issues if used in the same playset with them.

NOT achievement compatible ([i]Only UI mods that don't change features can be[/i])

[h2] Features [/h2]

This mod introduces 59 new unique traits, available for leaders that have any of the ascension traits, from Psionic to the newly introduced Virtual. 

Every non-destiny trait has new unique art (with the destiny traits copying the design of the normal ascension traits), but all aim to still feel vanilla in style. 

There is a veteran trait for every combination of subclass and ascension traits, along with negative traits and a destiny trait for each ascension.
