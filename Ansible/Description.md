[h1] Ansible Technologies and Arcologies [/h1]

Stellaris lacks one of the most iconic Sci-Fi elements seen in galaxy-spanning stories: the ansible, a tool for infinite-range instantaneous communication first coined by prolific writer Ursula K LeGuin.

This mod adds new techs all branching from Ansible Theory all with custom art, and it adds a new type of ecumenopolis called a centrapolis which replaces production arcologies with arcologies that provide new jobs that give empire-wide benefits and becomes a must-have in any sprawling empire. 

The mod is currently only available in English (translators welcome).
