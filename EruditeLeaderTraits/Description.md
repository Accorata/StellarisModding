[h1] Erudite Leader Traits [/h1]

UPDATED FOR 3.11

Erudite Leader Traits is a small mod that adds many new veteran traits (and a destiny trait) that are available to any Erudite leader. The aim was to build upon the ascension paths to allow for more diverse roleplay/thematics and some new gameplay elements.

These leader traits are weighted to be somewhat rare and balanced to be slightly more powerful than an average trait, however like any leader trait, their effectiveness will vary on the current strategy.

The mod is currently only available in English (translators welcome).

Features require Galactic Paragons DLC, and one trait will be modified slightly based on other DLCs. ([i]Astral Rifts Exploration[/i])

Zero base game files harmed (Should be compatible with all other mods)
(Should also work properly with any mods that allow for multiple ascension paths, such as allowing Cybernetic Psionics)
